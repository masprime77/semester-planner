# Lectio

A minimal, framework-free **native desktop app** for planning a university
semester. Track readings and tasks per course, per week, with click-to-cycle
status badges and per-course progress bars. Each semester is a plain JSON file —
there's no database and no server. The UI is vanilla JS in an
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) window; the Electron main process reads
and writes the JSON files directly via Node.js.

## Download

**[⬇ Download for macOS (Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/masprime77/lectio/releases/latest/download/Lectio-arm64.dmg)**

That is a permanent link — it always serves the `.dmg` from the **latest**
release. Open it, drag **Lectio** onto Applications, and launch it (see
[First launch on macOS](#first-launch-on-macos-gatekeeper) the first time). You
can also browse the [releases page](https://github.com/masprime77/lectio/releases/latest)
or install via [Homebrew](#install-via-homebrew-tap).

**[⬇ Download for Windows](https://github.com/masprime77/lectio/releases/latest)** —
grab `Lectio-Setup.exe` from the latest release page. Run it and follow
**Next → Next → Install** (see
[First launch on Windows](#first-launch-on-windows-smartscreen) the first time).

Or install on macOS via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap masprime77/tap && brew install --cask lectio
```

## Features

- **Semester selector** — switch between all `.json` semesters with labelled
  Edit and Delete controls; delete requires confirmation.
- **Two layouts** — toggle between **Weekly view** and **All Courses**; choice
  persists in `localStorage`:
  - *Weekly view* — collapsible week sections (current week auto-expands);
    one card per course showing that week's readings and tasks.
  - *All Courses* — one column per course (uniform 300 px, independent scroll).
    Each column groups readings and tasks under collapsible per-week dividers
    (current week auto-expanded). Long course names truncated with a tooltip.
- **Dashboard** — per-course progress bars and current-week indicator.
  Click a course name to enter **focus mode** (column centres and widens,
  others dim). Click again or press Esc to exit.
  The **Breakdown** toggle opens an inline panel showing separate
  readings and tasks mini-bars with done/total counts per course, plus a Total
  summary row for the semester.
- **Bulk collapse controls** — Expand all / Collapse all / Expand current week
  buttons in the header act on whichever layout is active.
- **Custom tag system** — each semester defines its own reading tags and task
  tags grouped into *Pending* and *Done* sections. Clicking a status badge opens
  a dropdown to pick any tag. Done-section tags count toward progress. Protected
  tags ("pending" / "studied") cannot be renamed or deleted but can be recolored.
  Custom tags can be added, renamed, recolored, and dragged to reorder in the
  Tags tab of the semester modal.
- **Study Mode** — header toggle (persisted) that narrows progress to items
  tagged "studied" only. A green "Studied" shortcut appears at the bottom of the
  status dropdown while Study Mode is on.
- **Sort control** — order courses by progress (↓/↑), alphabetically (A → Z /
  Z → A), or by week (↑/↓). Persists in `localStorage`; never rewrites the JSON
  file. Progress and alphabetical sorts apply to the dashboard and All Courses
  view; week sorts also reorder the weeks themselves.
- **Inline editing** — click a title to rename; `×` to delete; add rows at the
  bottom of each section for new readings/tasks.
- **Inline due-date editing** — tasks with a due date show a clickable
  "due YYYY-MM-DD" badge that opens an inline date picker (commit on blur/Enter,
  cancel on Escape, clear the field to remove the date). Tasks without one reveal
  a "＋ date" affordance on row hover.
- **＋ New button** — opens the semester modal, which has three tabs:
  *Semester* (name, start date, number of weeks), *Courses* (add/edit/reorder
  courses with accent colors), and *Tags* (manage reading and task tags).
- **Autosave & manual save** — every change autosaves after a 500 ms debounce
  with a header **Saving… → ✓ Saved** indicator. Save immediately with
  **⌘S / Ctrl+S** or **File → Save**. An **Unsaved changes** indicator and a
  save-before-quit dialog protect your work.
- **Session restore** — reopens the last active semester and view on launch;
  falls back gracefully if the semester was deleted.
- **Onboarding tour** — auto-launches on first run; replay any time via
  Settings → Tutorial. Each step spotlights a real UI element with a cutout
  and tooltip; supports Back / Next / Skip and keyboard navigation.
- **Feedback** — send feedback directly from the app without leaving it or
  needing a GitHub account.
- **Theme** — select **Light**, **Dark**, or **Auto** in Settings (⌘,).
  Auto follows `prefers-color-scheme` and updates live; applied before first
  paint to avoid any flash.
- **Typography** — [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) for body
  text and [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) for headings and
  course names, loaded from Google Fonts.
- **Auto-updates** — checks GitHub Releases on launch and downloads updates in
  the background; shows a dismissible banner with a one-click **Restart to
  update** (macOS via `latest-mac.yml`, Windows via `latest.yml`).

## Development

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18+). Install dependencies and launch
the app from source:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `electron .`, which opens the desktop window directly — no
terminal interaction, no browser, no `localhost`. Use `npm run dev` to launch
with DevTools open. You can also double-click **`start.command`** in Finder to
run the app from source without a terminal.

In development the app reads and writes the project's own `semesters/` folder.

## Testing

The core logic is extracted into `lib/` (pure, DOM-free modules) and tested with
[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/):

```bash
npm test            # run the suite once
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # run with a V8 coverage report (written to coverage/)
```

- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/`) cover status cycling, progress calculation,
  course CRUD, and the filesystem store.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/`) drive the IPC handlers through a
  mock `ipcMain` against a temp directory.
- Coverage thresholds are enforced at **70% lines** and **70% functions**
  (see `vitest.config.mjs`); the run fails if they aren't met.

CI runs the suite on **macOS** and **Ubuntu** (Node 20) on every push and on
pull requests to `main`, and uploads the coverage report as an artifact. A
release is only built once CI passes — see
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) and
[`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml). Feature-to-test traceability
lives in [`docs/USER_STORIES.md`](docs/USER_STORIES.md).

## Build for distribution

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

This runs [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) and produces, in the
**`dist/`** folder:

- a **`.dmg`** installer — drag-and-drop, ready to share or upload to a GitHub
  Release, and
- a **`.zip`** of the `.app` (used by the Homebrew cask and auto-update).

The `.dmg` opens to a drag-to-install window — drag **Lectio** onto
the Applications shortcut, then launch it like any native Mac app.

### First launch on macOS (Gatekeeper)

Builds are **ad-hoc signed** but not notarized (no paid Apple Developer ID), so
macOS Gatekeeper blocks a freshly downloaded copy the first time. Do this once:

> **First launch:** right-click **Lectio** in Applications → **Open** →
> **Open**. If macOS still refuses (e.g. *"is damaged and can't be opened"*),
> clear the download quarantine flag once:
>
> ```bash
> xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Lectio.app"
> ```

This is only needed on first launch; updates after that open normally.

**Why:** downloaded files get a `com.apple.quarantine` attribute, and without a
notarized signature Gatekeeper distrusts the app. The `xattr` command removes
that flag. The build is ad-hoc signed via the `afterPack` hook so its signature
is valid (which is what avoids the unrecoverable "damaged" state).

### First launch on Windows (SmartScreen)

On Windows, build the installer with:

```bash
npm run build:win
```

This produces, in the **`dist/`** folder, a **`Lectio Setup <version>.exe`**
[NSIS](https://www.electron.build/configuration/nsis) installer (plus a `.zip`
of the app and `latest.yml` for auto-updates). Run the installer and follow
**Next → Next → Install** — you can pick the install directory, and it creates
**Desktop** and **Start Menu** shortcuts.

The installer and app are **not** signed with a paid certificate, so the first
time you run a freshly downloaded copy, **Windows Defender SmartScreen** may show
a blue *"Windows protected your PC"* warning. Do this once:

> **First launch:** click **More info** → **Run anyway**. This only appears once.

This is the Windows equivalent of macOS Gatekeeper above; once you've allowed it,
updates after that launch normally.

To produce a fully **signed + notarized** build instead — so downloads open with
no prompt at all — set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (plus `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`,
and a Developer ID cert via `CSC_LINK` / `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`) before building. The
`afterPack` hook then defers to electron-builder's signing and the `afterSign`
hook notarizes automatically.

## Updating the app icon

Replace `assets/icon.png` (1024×1024) with your artwork, then rebuild the `.icns`:

```bash
npm run icon       # assets/icon.png → assets/icon.icns (macOS: sips + iconutil)
npm run icon:win   # assets/icon.png → assets/icon.ico (cross-platform, Node 20+)
npm run icons      # rebuild both icon.icns and icon.ico
```

Commit both files and ship the new icon in the next release. Full details (the
generated sizes, DMG background, and caching tips) are in
[`docs/UPDATING_THE_ICON.md`](docs/UPDATING_THE_ICON.md).

## How it works (IPC, no HTTP)

The renderer never touches the filesystem directly. `preload.js` uses
`contextBridge` to expose a small, safe `window.planner` API; each method calls
`ipcRenderer.invoke`, and the main process handles it with `ipcMain.handle`:

| Renderer call (`window.planner.*`) | IPC channel       | Main process action            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `listSemesters()`                  | `list-semesters`  | List all semester files        |
| `getSemester(id)`                  | `get-semester`    | Read a semester JSON           |
| `saveSemester(id, data)`           | `save-semester`   | Write a semester JSON          |
| `deleteSemester(id)`               | `delete-semester` | Delete a semester file         |

`id` is the filename without `.json` and must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (this
guards against path traversal). `ipcRenderer` is never exposed to the renderer.

Two more `contextBridge` bridges follow the same pattern: **`window.updater`**
(auto-update events + restart) and **`window.saver`** (the File → Save trigger,
unsaved-changes reporting, and the save-before-quit handshake).

### Where your data lives

- **Development:** the project's `semesters/` folder.
- **Packaged app:** `~/Library/Application Support/Lectio/semesters/`
  (`app.getPath('userData')`), so your data persists across app updates. On
  first launch the app seeds this folder with the bundled `example.json`.

## Adding a semester manually

Create a new file in the active `semesters/` folder (the project folder in
development, or `~/Library/Application Support/Lectio/semesters/` for
the installed app), e.g. `ws2025.json`. The filename (without `.json`) is the
semester's id. Follow this schema:

```json
{
  "id": "ws2025",
  "name": "Winter Semester 2025",
  "startDate": "2025-10-13",
  "weeks": 15,
  "courses": [
    {
      "id": "course-1",
      "name": "Algorithms",
      "color": "#4A90D9",
      "readings": [
        {
          "id": "r-1",
          "week": 1,
          "title": "Chapter 1: Introduction",
          "status": "pending"
        }
      ],
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": "t-1",
          "week": 1,
          "title": "Exercise Set 1",
          "dueDate": "2025-10-20",
          "status": "not done"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Field reference:

- `startDate` — ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) of the Monday of week 1. Week dates and
  the "current week" indicator are computed from this.
- `weeks` — total number of weeks in the semester.
- `color` — any CSS color; used as the course card's accent and progress bar.
- Reading `status` — a tag id from the semester's `readingTags` list
  (e.g. `"r-pending"`, `"r-studied"`). Legacy strings (`"pending"`,
  `"seen"`, etc.) are migrated automatically on load.
- Task `status` — a tag id from the semester's `taskTags` list
  (e.g. `"t-pending"`, `"t-done"`). Legacy strings (`"not done"`, `"done"`,
  etc.) are migrated automatically on load.
- All `id` values must be unique within their list.

The directory is read each time the list loads, so a new file shows up in the
selector the next time the app launches (or when you reselect from the dropdown).

## Releasing

Releases are built and published automatically by CI:

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and commit.
2. Push a matching tag, e.g. `git tag v1.0.1 && git push origin v1.0.1`.
3. [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs the full CI suite first
   (`needs: ci`) and, only if it passes, builds on macOS and Windows in parallel
   and publishes the `.dmg`, `.zip`, and **`latest-mac.yml`** (macOS), and the
   `.exe`, `.zip`, and **`latest.yml`** (Windows) to the GitHub Release for that
   tag.

To build locally without publishing, run `npm run build:mac` (artifacts land in
`dist/`).

## Auto-updates

The app uses [electron-updater](https://www.electron.build/auto-update) against
GitHub Releases (configured via the `build.publish` field in `package.json`).

- On launch, the packaged app calls `checkForUpdatesAndNotify()` and compares the
  installed version against the latest published release (using `latest-mac.yml`).
- When a newer version exists it downloads in the background and shows a banner:
  *"A new version is available, downloading…"*.
- Once downloaded, the banner offers **Restart to update**, which calls
  `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()`. The banner can also be dismissed.
- Update errors are logged silently and never crash the app.

Auto-updates only run in the packaged app from a published release — in
development it's a no-op. The renderer talks to the updater only through the
`window.updater` bridge in [`preload.js`](preload.js); `ipcRenderer` is never
exposed.

## Install via Homebrew (tap)

Install the GUI app with a **Cask** — it copies `Lectio.app` straight
into `/Applications`. The cask lives at
[`homebrew/Casks/lectio.rb`](homebrew/Casks/lectio.rb); it
downloads the release `.zip` and its `postflight` clears the download quarantine
so the (ad-hoc signed) app opens on first launch without manual steps.

**Publish it to your tap** so others can install with one command:

1. Create a repo named **`homebrew-tap`** on your GitHub account (the
   `homebrew-` prefix is what makes `brew tap masprime77/tap` resolve). Clone it
   next to this project (so it sits at `../homebrew-tap`).

2. Cut a release first (push a `v*` tag), then publish the cask to the tap — one
   command refreshes `version`/`sha256` from the release, copies the cask into
   the tap's `Casks/`, and commits + pushes it:

   ```bash
   homebrew/sync-tap.sh                  # version defaults to package.json
   # tap path defaults to ../homebrew-tap; override with TAP_DIR=/path/to/tap
   ```

   (`homebrew/update-cask.sh <version>` just does the version/sha256 refresh if
   you want that step on its own.)

3. Anyone can then install (and upgrade / uninstall) the app with:

   ```bash
   brew tap masprime77/tap
   brew install --cask lectio
   ```

> The app is currently built for **Apple Silicon (arm64)** only (the cask has
> `depends_on arch: :arm64`). For Intel support, add an `x64` (or `universal`)
> build target and a matching `on_intel`/`on_arm` block in the cask.
