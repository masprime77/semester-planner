## Unreleased

- Week sections inside each course column (All Courses view) are now collapsible via a chevron toggle; the current week is expanded by default and all others are collapsed, with each section's open/closed state persisted while navigating.
- Added header controls to bulk expand all, collapse all, or expand only the current week; the buttons act on whichever layout is active (Weekly view or All Courses view).
- Course view columns now render at a uniform fixed width (300px) regardless of course name length.
- Long course names are truncated with an ellipsis and reveal the full name via a native tooltip on hover.
- Renamed the header view toggle labels: "Week view" → "Weekly view" and "Course view" → "All Courses" (internal view values unchanged).
- Added a focused single-course mode: clicking a course name in the progress bar isolates that course's column (centred, wider) and dims the other progress rows; clicking it again restores the normal layout.
- Focused mode can also be exited by clicking the empty space around the column or pressing the Esc key.
- Added a global "+ Add" button in the header (shown once a semester is loaded) that opens a modal for adding a reading or task to any course and week of the current semester, with a Reading/Task toggle (Task reveals an optional due-date field) and the current week pre-selected.
- Added a header sort control to order courses by progress (↓/↑) or by their earliest week with content (↑/↓); the choice applies to the progress bars, course columns, and week-view cards, and persists across restarts (localStorage). Sorting is non-destructive — the underlying course order on disk is never changed.
- The sort control bakes a "Sort: " prefix into each option label, so the active mode reads as "Sort: <mode>" directly in the select (no separate label element).
- Added alphabetical course sort options (A → Z and Z → A) to the sort control.
- Scoped the progress and alphabetical sorts to the progress bar and All Courses columns only; the Weekly view keeps the original course order for those modes (only week sorts reorder it).
- The Week ↓ sort now also reverses the order of the weeks themselves — weeks render N … 1 in both the Weekly view and inside each All Courses column (Week ↑ stays ascending).
